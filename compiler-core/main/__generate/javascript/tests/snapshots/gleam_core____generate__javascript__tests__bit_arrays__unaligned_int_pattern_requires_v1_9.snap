----- WARNING
warning: Incompatible gleam version range
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.gleam:3:18
  │
3 │   let assert <<_:3>> = <<0>>
  │                  ^ This requires a Gleam version >= 1.9.0

Use of unaligned bit arrays on the JavaScript target was introduced in
version v1.9.0. But the Gleam version range specified in your `gleam.toml`
would allow this code to run on an earlier version like v1.8.0, resulting
in compilation errors!
Hint: Remove the version constraint from your `gleam.toml` or update it to be:

    gleam = ">= 1.9.0"
