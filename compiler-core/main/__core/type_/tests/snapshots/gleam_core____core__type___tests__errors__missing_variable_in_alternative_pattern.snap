error: Missing alternative pattern variable
  ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:1:11
  │
1 │ case [] { [x] | [] -> x _ -> 0 }
  │           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ This does not define all required variables

All alternative patterns must define the same variables as the initial
pattern, but the `x` variable is missing.
