----- WARNING
warning: Incompatible gleam version range
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.gleam:4:3
  │
4 │   tuple.1.0
  │   ^^^^^^^^^ This requires a Gleam version >= 1.1.0

The ability to access nested tuple fields was introduced in version v1.1.0.
But the Gleam version range specified in your `gleam.toml` would allow this
code to run on an earlier version like v1.0.0, resulting in compilation
errors!
Hint: Remove the version constraint from your `gleam.toml` or update it to be:

    gleam = ">= 1.1.0"
