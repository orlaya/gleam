----- WARNING
warning: Incompatible gleam version range
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.gleam:4:14
  │
4 │     <<_:size(3*8)>> -> 1
  │              ^^^ This requires a Gleam version >= 1.12.0

Expressions in segment sizes were introduced in version v1.12.0. But the
Gleam version range specified in your `gleam.toml` would allow this code to
run on an earlier version like v1.0.0, resulting in compilation errors!
Hint: Remove the version constraint from your `gleam.toml` or update it to be:

    gleam = ">= 1.12.0"
